widget-debug
------------

A simple debug() function I use for widget development.

It gives you three ways to debug:

1) widget.showNotification()
2) opera.postError()
3) a div displaying your debug messages

First open debug.js and edit parameters as you like (e.g. turn off widet.showNotification() or change background-color of the div).
Then just add debug("MyMessage"); to your code and you're done.

You can leave all the debug() calls in your production ready code by turning all debug modes off.
No need to search for debug messages anymore ;)
